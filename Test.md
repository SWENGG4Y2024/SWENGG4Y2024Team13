## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the testing approach, strategies, and procedures for the Agriculture Dashboard Application. It aims to ensure the reliability, usability, and performance of the application in meeting the needs of farmers, agricultural experts, regulatory authorities, and developers.

## 2. Test Plan

### 2.1 Scope
The testing scope includes functional and non-functional aspects of the Agriculture Dashboard Application, covering user interface, data accuracy, security, performance, and compliance with regulatory standards.

### 2.2 Objectives
- Verify the functionality of the application modules, including Dashboard UI, Chat Interface, Calendar, Journal, Insights, and Autopilot.
- Validate the accuracy and reliability of data presented to users, including weather information, market prices, and crop insights.
- Assess the security measures implemented to protect user data and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Evaluate the performance of the application under different usage scenarios, including peak loads and adverse network conditions.
- Identify and address usability issues related to outdoor usage, including button placement and color scheme visibility.
- Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to involve stakeholders, such as farmers, in the testing process and gather feedback on usability and functionality.

### 2.3 Approach
- Test cases will be developed based on user stories, requirements specifications, and use cases provided by stakeholders.
- Testing will encompass functional testing, regression testing, usability testing, security testing, performance testing, and compliance testing.
- Automated testing tools will be utilized for regression testing and performance testing to streamline testing efforts and ensure repeatability.
- Test environments will be set up to simulate real-world usage conditions, including outdoor environments with varying lighting conditions and network connectivity.

### 2.4 Test Deliverables
- Test cases and test scenarios
- Test scripts for automated testing
- Test reports summarizing test results and findings
- Defect reports documenting issues identified during testing, including severity and priority levels
